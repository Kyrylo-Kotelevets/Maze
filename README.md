# Some information about maze
The repository contains an implementation of a simple visualization and maze generation algorithm based on depth-first traversal.

A labyrinth is a structure (usually in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space), consisting of intricate paths to the exit (and / or paths leading to a dead end).

The ancient Greeks and Romans referred to a labyrinth as a more or less vast space, consisting of numerous halls, chambers, courtyards and passages, arranged according to a complex and intricate plan, in order to confuse and prevent a person who is ignorant of the labyrinth from getting out.

It is believed that if you go through the maze, touching only one of the edges of its walls, then the maze will definitely be completed, although this is not always true: in a maze with unconnected walls, this method may not work.

Here some examples of maze and its solution:
